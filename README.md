# FPGA train controller project 

This projects enables us to send signals to a little train that will go forward or backward, turn its lights on or off, broadcast messages or not, and in the case it's moving we can increase or decrease its speed.
The commands are send through signals that have to respect certain requirements to be differentiated. 
More details coming.
